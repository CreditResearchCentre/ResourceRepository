                        the Concentration in the Rating Grades</a>
                    <p>This set of slides outlines the basic metrics for measuring Concentration among PD risk grades,
                        and the European regulatory requirements for reporting them. Andrija’s presentation gives
                        helpful commentary to calculate these metrics. This
                        should be read and explored by all students of quantitative risk management and by model
                        managers, as an example of best practice and regulatory requirement for Credit Risk IRB.

                        Partial
                        Portfolio</a>
                    <p>This folder contains Andrija’s presentation summary of the IMF’s Partial Portfolio Approach to
                        Concentration Risk, with illustrating data and code in R and Python. The IMF’s hybrid model of
                        portfolio credit risk has a structure that maintains good performance even in the presence of
                        high name-exposure concentrations, and therefore is an important model option and a mitigation
                        of Concentration Risk. This should be read by model developers and model risk managers as an
                        example where model structure has mitigated a potential model error, so helping manage the
                        specification risk of the model.

                        class-imbalance learning, machine learning fairness, and experiments with XGBoost using
                        custom loss functions, alongside Naive Bayes scorecards.</p>

                    <p>This document outlines the scorecard boosting package, detailing the key steps involved in
                        constructing a scorecard from gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT). It also covers
                        practical use cases, including handling categorical data and deploying a boosted scorecard
                        with SQL.</p>

                    <a href="Pdfs/2009SpecificationErrors.pdf">Specification Errors in Stress Testing Models</a>
                    <p>This paper highlights how stress testing models for retail lending often suffer from inherent
                        specification errors when incorporating lifecycle, credit quality, and macroeconomic effects.
                        Drawing parallels to Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models, the authors show that these interdependent
                        factors create ambiguity in trend attribution, which limits model reliability, especially for
                        out-of-sample stress testing.</p>


                    <a href="Pdfs/glm-avt.pdf">Incorporating lifecycle and environment in
                        loan-level forecasts and stress tests</a>
                    <p>This paper introduces a loan-level Age-Vintage-Time (AVT) modeling approach to forecast credit
                        risk by separating lifecycle effects, macroeconomic environment, and loan vintage quality. It
                        extends Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models with retrending techniques and incorporates them into a
                        Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework. The work demonstrates, using a US auto loan dataset,
                        that this method not only improves out-of-sample and out-of-time prediction accuracy but also
                        provides stable and robust loan-level forecasts and stress tests, aligning with regulatory
                        requirements like IFRS 9 and CECL.</p>

                        Models: How APC Predicted the US Mortgage Crisis, but Also Does So Much More</a>
                    <p>This paper introduces Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models and demonstrates their versatility beyond
                        traditional use in epidemiology and demography. It shows how APC models not only explained the
                        U.S. mortgage crisis by decomposing loan performance into lifecycle, vintage, and environmental
                        effects, but also apply to diverse areas such as wine price forecasting, user behavior, and
                        tree-ring analysis for climate change</p>
